# HR Analytics & WOTC Tracking Project

This is an ongoing data engineering project designed to help organizations track employees eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and monitor their progress toward the 400-hour threshold.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end HR analytics workflow, from synthetic data generation to data modeling and dashboard-ready outputs.

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Enable HR and finance teams to identify WOTC-eligible employees, track hours worked, and generate actionable insights for tax credit compliance.

**Key Features (Planned / In Progress):**

- Synthetic datasets for employees, weekly hours, and WOTC eligibility
- Centralized database for reporting and analytics
- Monitoring of employee progress toward 400 hours
- Dashboard-ready data model for visualization
- Modular design to add new HR analytics features over time


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13 for data generation and manipulation
- SQLite or Postgres for database storage
- Pandas and Faker for synthetic data creation
- Dashboard tools (e.g., Metabase, Power BI, Tableau) for visualization
- GitHub Automation Tool
## Project Workflow

1. Generate synthetic data – employee profiles, weekly hours, and WOTC eligibility
2. Load data into database – centralized storage for analytics
3. Data modeling – prepare data for reporting dashboards
4. Monitor employee progress – track hours worked toward the 400-hour WOTC threshold

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time integration with HRIS systems
- Automated alerts for employees nearing 400 hours
- Extended analytics for HR KPIs (attrition, performance, payroll insights)
- Full dashboard integration with interactive reporting
